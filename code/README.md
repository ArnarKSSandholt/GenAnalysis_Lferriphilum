##Code

This readme runs through the code that was used for the analysis.

The .sh files are bash scripts used to run the main portions of the analysis through UPPMAX.  These were usually computationally heavy and needed the resources available there.  Further explanation for them can be found in the wiki.

The R file contains the code used to run the differential expression analysis using the R package DESeq2 as well as code for plotting the data.

The .py files contain code that was used to manipulate the annotation data and create CSV files as well as for manipulating the results of the differential expression analysis.

Finally, the misc_commands.txt file contains commands run on UPPMAX that were simple enough to run directly.
