# Genome Analysis

Project for the course Genome Analysis at Uppsala University

This project aims to reproduce the results of Christel et al in their paper [Multi-omics Reveals the Lifestyle of the Acidophilic, Mineral-Oxidizing Model Species Leptospirillum ferriphilum](https://aem.asm.org/content/84/3/e02091-17)

For a report on the analysis, please take a look at the wiki.  The results of the analysis can be found in the analyses folder, the code used to run it in the code folder and some metadata on the data that the analyses were run on in the data folder.
